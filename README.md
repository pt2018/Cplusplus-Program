# Cplusplus-Program
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This program is an Item Tracker created for a fictional grocer company. It iterates through a list of items sold and records number of sales for each item in a new file. It allows the user to choose from a menu of options to view the data in different formats - a list, a histogram, and in a search for a specific/individual item. This program allows the user to parse through data and view it in a readable format in order to curate information. 


What did you do particularly well?

I felt like being able to solve each individual problem (iterating through the file and turning it into a list, then turning it into a histogram, and then allowing for individual searches) was my proudest accomplisment in this code. I was able to successfully parse the file so that the information was readable and transferrable, allowing it to be presented to the user properly and accurately. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I think being able to trim the code so that it is more readable would be a good start. Being able to properly sort and format each function can allow for addition of further functionality, and can allow it to built upon as well. In addition, adding more visual enhancements can help the user better navigate the menu and options instead of having it be bare bones. I also would want to find an better way to accept file input, read file input, and create a new files securely. Being able to better account for invalid inputs would also be more intuitive. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

I think the most challenging code to write was the ones where I had to iterate through items in the file or search for items in the map I used. Properly grabbing values stumped me and having to learn about maps on the fly was also difficult as I'd never worked with them before. Grabbing upon C++ resources such as books and C++ websites to reference really helped me learn what I could and couldn't do with this new tool. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Being able to learn new facest fo C++ on the go while also being able to research new tools to better solve my problem is invaluable. Maps were probably the best answer to my ability to parse through items that required a key:value pair. Learning which tool to use at which moment is something I covet and anticipate on using on the future very often. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made sure this code had function names and variable names that made sense, which allowed readability to be strong. It reduced having to guess what the purpose of something was, and made the code seamless to go through. Eacb function and variable flowed into each other which made it easier to figure out any issues I had when debugging.
